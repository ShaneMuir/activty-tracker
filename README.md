# Fitness Tracker App

Inspiration for this app came from [Vue 3 & Supabase | Workout Tracker App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tF0fGkd4ho)
I have taken what I've learnt from this tutorial and many others YT vids along with some material from [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/)
to come up with this Fitness Tracker App.

### Things I want to add to the project

- Re-design
